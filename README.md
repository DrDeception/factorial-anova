This shiny visualisation lets you look at what happens to the Sums of Squares in an ANOVA when you add main effects, or interaction effects. It also gives brief descriptions of how the sums of squares are calculated.

Many thanks to Jan Freyberg for developing this Shiny. It was the first I really got to poke around in, and am delighted to be able to use it with students to help them visualise the ANOVA. Cheers Jan!
